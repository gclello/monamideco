The current layout of the Mon Ami Déco website is based on the Jekyll version of the original Start Bootstrap Agency Theme, created by Rick Kim and David Miller, respectively. Both themes are based on the Golden PSD Theme by FreebiesXpress.com. If you are looking for the website template, please refer to these themes.

The image carousel in the opening section is implemented using Slick by Ken Wheeler.

The navigation header animation uses the file cbpAnimatedHeader.js by Codrops.

All the icons are part of the awesome Font Awesome icon toolkit by Dave Gandy.

The website uses extensively the bootstrap (created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton) and jQuery (by jQuery Foundation) frameworks and is generated using Jekyll (by Tom Preston-Werner).
